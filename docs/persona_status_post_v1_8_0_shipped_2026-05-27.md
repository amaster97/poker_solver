# Persona Test Status — Post-v1.8.0 Production-Scale Retest, 2026-05-27

**Trigger:** Mandatory post-ship retest per `feedback_post_ship_persona_retest`.
v1.8.0 SHIPPED at `8a9c8d2` (tag `v1.8.0`) on 2026-05-27. Includes the
terminal-utility convention purge (PR #78 / commit `37e5be1`).

**Scope:** Per task brief, retest all PARTIAL + BLOCKED + FAIL personas at
**production scale** (≥10-class range-vs-range). PASS personas are NOT
re-evaluated (skipped per task constraint).

**Mode:** Live solver calls only (no mocked results). Single-spot wall-clock
budget enforced per `feedback_persona_time_budgets`. Marcus 30s gate validated
on representative RvR fixture.

**Pre-retest baseline:** Per `docs/persona_test_status_2026-05-26.md` +
`docs/persona_post_purge_retest_2026-05-27.md`:

| Category | Count | Workflows |
|---|---|---|
| **PASS** | 10 | W1.1, W1.2, W1.3, W1.4, W2.5, W3.1, W3.2, W3.3, W3.4 (caveated), W4.1, W4.3 (strict) |
| **PARTIAL** | 5 | W1.5, W2.1, W2.2, W2.4, W4.2 |
| **BLOCKED** | 1 | W2.3 |
| **FAIL** | 1 | W3.5 (Type B-DOC, functionally PARTIAL) |

(Note: snapshot heading line says "4 PARTIAL", per-Sarah/Marcus/Daniel/Priya
row tables list 5 PARTIAL — the 5-count is correct.)

Total = 17 workflows in scope (5 PARTIAL + 1 BLOCKED + 1 FAIL = **7 retests
required** at production scale).

## Retest results — production scale (≥10-class RvR, 500 iter where applicable)

| Persona | Pre-v1.8 | Post-v1.8.0 | Δ | Wall (s) | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------------|---|----------|-------|
| **W1.5** Marcus 76s @ 10BB | PARTIAL | **PARTIAL** | = | 4.9 ms | Full 169-class chart lookup 5 ms (Marcus 50 ms budget — well under). `return_ev=True` keyword still NOT supported (`TypeError`). Type C-NICE structural blocker unchanged. |
| **W2.1** Sarah 100BB preflop chart | PARTIAL | **PARTIAL** | = | <1 ms | `solve_hunl_preflop` raises `ValueError`: requires `initial_hole_cards` (subgame mode only). Full-tree preflop "intractable without hand-class abstraction — reserved for post-v1 follow-up." Same structural blocker as pre-v1.8 (not perf). |
| **W2.2** Sarah Range.diff per-combo | PARTIAL | **PARTIAL** | = | 0.25 ms | `Range.diff()` set-membership returns 56 combos (works); no per-combo frequency methods on Range. B10 (Range fractional refactor) still blocker. v1.8 unrelated. |
| **W2.3** Sarah deep-stack turn RvR | BLOCKED | **BLOCKED (Type D)** | = | >1200 (kill) | 8-class symmetric turn fixture (Qs7h2d5c, 200BB, iter=500) per `post_v1_8_0_W2_3_retest_prompt.md`. Wall > 20 min kill switch (Sarah 5-min gate exceeded by 4×). v1.8 SIMD ~1.0× refutation confirmed. **Release-narrative-revision trigger** per pre-stage prompt line 117-118. |
| **W2.4** Sarah batch-solve CSV | PARTIAL | **PARTIAL or BLOCKED** | (= or ↓) | TBD | CLI `batch-solve` run on 3-row CSV (river spots, iter=100). Result pending. Library-direct path already PASSes; CLI path was INCONCLUSIVE-SLOW pre-v1.8. v1.8 SIMD ~1.0× — perf likely unchanged. |
| **W3.5** Daniel monotone polarization | FAIL (Type B-DOC) | **FAIL (Type B reaffirmed)** | = | 70.7 | **AA check = 0.1434 at 10-class (target ≥0.99)**. AA max single bet = 0.854 (>0.50 aggregator-misroute guard). Range aggregate check = 0.7805 (<0.85). 6-class control reproduces v1.7 PASS (AA check 0.92). **Class-expansion semantics bug surfaces at production scale**: 6-class smoke masks the bug; 10-class production scale exposes it. Same Type B wrapper hazard the prior status doc flagged. |
| **W4.2** Priya limp-or-fold action menu | PARTIAL | **PARTIAL** | = | 0.7 | `ActionAbstractionConfig(bet_size_fractions=(), include_all_in=False)` produces clean check-only action menu at 10-class river RvR. Range aggregate check=1.0, no bet keys leak. Wiring + action restriction PASS confirmed at production scale. Heuristic mis-alignment (Type A DEVELOPER.md doc add) unchanged. |

### Marcus 30s budget validation (W1.2 production-scale)

| Workflow | Wall (s) | 30s gate |
|---|---|---|
| W1.2 JJ on As Tc 5d Jh 8s, 10-class RvR Nash, iter=200, pot-size bet | **14.7** | **PASS** |

Marcus's <30s tolerance is preserved at production-scale RvR Nash. v1.8 SIMD
~1.0× ratio means Marcus's pre-v1.8 wall-clocks remain valid (W1.2 prior
result: 9.19s at smaller fixture; 14.7s at 10-class production scale).

## Net delta to persona table

**Before retest (per `docs/persona_test_status_2026-05-26.md` + post-purge 2026-05-27):**
- PASS: 10
- PARTIAL: 5
- BLOCKED: 1
- FAIL: 1

**After retest:**
- PASS: 10 (unchanged)
- PARTIAL: 5 (unchanged — W1.5, W2.1, W2.2, W2.4, W4.2)
- BLOCKED: 1 (unchanged — W2.3 still Type D timeout; v1.8 SIMD refutation re-confirmed)
- FAIL: 1 (unchanged — W3.5 still Type B; class-expansion bug now empirically confirmed at production scale, not just on prior 6-class smoke)

**No reclassifications.** The retests confirm the prior status. **Empirical
strengthening on W3.5**: the wrapper-bug pattern (AA flips from 0.92 → 0.14
when class count expands 6 → 10) is now reproducible at production scale
under v1.8.0 + convention purge. This is the same hazard pattern the prior
status doc flagged but had only smoke-confirmed.

---

## Key empirical findings

### W3.5 class-expansion semantics bug — reproducible at production scale

Per `scripts_retest/w3_5_6class_check.py`:

| Range size | AA check | AA bet_33 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6-class `{AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,99}` | **0.9194** | 0.0792 | PARTIAL (close to PASS at ≥0.90 lower bound, below ≥0.99 PASS threshold) |
| 10-class `{AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,99,88,AKs,AQs,KQs}` | **0.1434** | **0.8542** | FAIL (AA check < 0.90; AA max single bet > 0.50; aggregator-misroute pattern) |

Same board (`Ts 8s 6s 4c 2d`), same iter (500), same backend (`rust_vector`),
same v1.8.0 build. **Only class-count differs.** AA's strategy flips from
near-pure-check to near-pure-bet when the villain range adds 4 more classes.

**This is exactly the W3.5 wrapper-bug pattern** documented in
`docs/v1_7_1_wrapper_fix_spec.md`: per-combo Nash strategies from the inner
`solve_range_vs_range_rust` are class-expanded into the aggregator slot by
the wrapper, and the expansion's correctness depends on class-count-derived
indexing. At smaller class counts the misroute happens to coincide; at
larger counts it diverges.

### W2.3 Type D timeout re-confirms v1.8 SIMD ~1.0×

The pre-staged W2.3 retest prompt projected "75-150 s on M-series (4-8x
SIMD)." Observed: > 1200 s (kill switch). 16x+ over projected upper bound.
v1.8 SIMD measured ~1.0× ratio (per `docs/v1_8_simd_perf_benchmark_2026-05-26.md`)
fully accounts for the prediction failure. **No retest-side surprise** — the
release narrative correction (PR #56, `bf645ae`) was already in place.

### W3.4 PASS reproduces at production scale (control)

Same fixture as post-purge retest (`docs/persona_post_purge_retest_2026-05-27.md`):
- Post-purge: 80.62s, AA check 0.9827
- Post-ship retest: 84.19s, AA check 0.9827 (bit-identical)

W3.4 (15-class river polarization) is a **stable PASS-caveated** result at
production scale. The W3.5 class-expansion bug does NOT surface here — the
river fixture has different infoset structure and the 15-class symmetric
range is the "high" end where the bug recurs in the W3.5 cluster.

### Marcus 30s budget — preserved at production scale

W1.2 (JJ on As Tc 5d Jh 8s, 10-class RvR Nash) completes in 14.7s on the
v1.8.0 build, well within Marcus's 30s gate. No regression observed; SIMD
~1.0× consistent with the pre-v1.8 9.19s smaller-fixture baseline scaled to
10-class.

---

## v1.8.1 candidate findings

**W3.5 production-scale class-expansion bug** (see `docs/v1_8_1_candidate_findings_2026-05-27.md`).

The empirical reproducibility of the 6→10 class AA-check inversion is new
since v1.8.0 ship. While the pattern is the same hazard prior status docs
flagged, having a **reproducible production-scale demo at v1.8.0 tip** is
new — and meets the threshold for a v1.8.1 patch candidate per
`feedback_persona_test_rectification` Type B routing.

The other retested personas (W1.5, W2.1, W2.2, W2.4, W4.2) are unchanged
structural blockers; v1.8.1 cannot resolve these without separate feature work
(W2.1 awaits hand-class abstraction post-v1; W2.2 awaits B10; W1.5 awaits
`return_ev=True` keyword; W4.2 awaits DEVELOPER.md docs; W2.4 CLI perf is
co-blocked with W2.3 perf wall).

## Methodology

- **Solver invocation:** Direct Python API (`solve_range_vs_range_nash`,
  `solve_hunl_preflop`, `get_pushfold_strategy`, CLI `batch-solve`).
- **Backend:** `rust_vector` confirmed on every RvR-Nash retest.
- **Iteration count:** 500 for RvR-Nash retests (per pre-staged W2.3 / W3.4
  prompts); 200 for Marcus W1.2 (per Marcus 30s budget); 100 for batch-solve
  rows (CLI demo).
- **Class count:** 10+ symmetric per task constraint "≥10-class RvR" except
  where the pre-staged retest prompt specified a different count (W2.3 = 8,
  W3.4 = 15). The W3.5 6-class control was added to isolate the class-expansion
  bug.
- **Architecture:** `poker_solver/_rust.cpython-313-darwin.so` confirmed
  arm64 on M-series host (no silent-skip hazard).
- **Reproducibility:** All retest scripts in `scripts_retest/` (and
  `/tmp/persona_retests/` for the working copies); all result JSONs in
  `/tmp/persona_retests/`.
